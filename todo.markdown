# Automate TODO Management TODO List

**Last Updated:** July 15, 2025  
**Project Context:** Develop a system to manage per-project TODO lists with minimal manual file handling, integrated with a project management platform (e.g., grok.com Projects tab).  
**Notes:**  
- Focus on simplicity and compatibility with Markdown for project page attachments on grok.com.  
- Updates are managed via Grok 4 chat, with new `todo.markdown` generated per progress report.  
- Using Google Drive for file hosting; ensure direct download links are accessible.
